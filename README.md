### About

The plan is you can type in names of an item into a column/letter on GS and then a background processor will look those up, populate cell next to them.

I have built a similar thing with UPS using a Google App Script.

Using Google App Script is not ideal as far as general usability for people. So this is definintely a tool for me right now.

The App Script is because you can fire off events from the front end after editing a cell vs. waiting for some poll.

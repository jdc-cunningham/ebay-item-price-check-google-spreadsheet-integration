I got the approval so I guess that account just got stale/expired

I think I applied a while back and never used it

I'll have to use it soon

Well I'll see if I can test it real quick

I made a sandbox application key

Okay they have code samples

https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/browse/resources/item_summary/methods/search#h2-samples

looks like it's url query parameter based

uses Oauth

they have a nodejs client for oauth interesting

ahhh.... I wasn't really tring to do this now, Mondays are rough for me "amirite" I just mean I'm a dumbass and sleep in on the weekends

that's not because I'm not free yo (wannabe FIRE)

Ugh... I don't like oauth... how you have to have this redirect thing going

6:58 PM

the issue is say you receive your token, also the refresh bit, but if you're stop/run/stop/run doing basic dev stuff, you gotta keep track of this token, store it somewhere... eventually have an actual workflow that'll self-refresh it's just harder than having fixed keys that you use/send with payload (no redirect/expire)

JWT would be nice too

let me see if I can get this going, I want to fall asleep I feel angry

I momentarily closed my eyes micro slept and feel like crap

7:33 PM

8:25 PM

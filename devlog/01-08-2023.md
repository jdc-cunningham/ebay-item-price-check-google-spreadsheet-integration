Let me try again, I'm in a food coma right now

I'm working on this because all of my finances are "red lining" as in maxed out debt

I make good money but I also give a lot of it away so it's hard for me to pay my debts

This app is for knowing how much my stuff is worth at the given moment so if I need to sell I have an estimate on what I can get

Of course the amount of time it takes me to develop this will be more than me just looking it up WHEN/IF I need to

Waste of time? Probably

I don't want to say "I hate" but wtf eBay these docs man, show me code

I see they have OpenAPI specs at least but like how do I auth?

8:57 PM

well... my api registration was rejected great

I wonder if it's because this account is a seller?...

let me try a different email

allows you but then says "thank you... we are reviewing your account information"

so I guess this is on hold
